# Basic To-Do List Interface

## :clipboard: Project Overview

This project is a simple to-do list application built with React. The main objective of the project was to learn how to use React state to create, update, and delete tasks in the interface.

:warning: Please note that the application DOES NOT include any persistence mechanism, meaning the tasks are not saved when the page is refreshed or closed.
